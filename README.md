## Binary Classification with Logistic Regression – Threshold Tuning & Sigmoid Function
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a binary classification model using Logistic Regression in Python, with a focus on threshold tuning and understanding the sigmoid function.

### Project Objectives
    1.Load and preprocess a binary classification dataset.
    2.Train a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.
    3.Understand how the sigmoid function maps model outputs to probabilities.
    4.Evaluate model performance using:
            1.Confusion Matrix
            2.Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
            3.ROC-AUC Curve
    5.Perform threshold tuning to optimize classification performance.
    6.Visualize the relationship between precision, recall, and F1 across different thresholds.

### Tools & Libraries
    1.Python
    2.scikit-learn – model training & evaluation
    3.pandas – data handling
    4.numpy – numerical computations
    5.matplotlib – data visualization
